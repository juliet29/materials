## NRMCA -> Company Data format 
NRMCA data is initally very compact because all coming from the same Source. Expansion constants should all come from one file #TODO
Company data comes from different sources, so adding all data in the original file

- add company as NRMCA
- expand data to consider the different concrete mix compositions 

#TODO -> rename the files data.json?
