## About the data 
- Units for GWP: kg-co2-eq / m3
- Each GWP number represents a different alteration from a standard mix

  - #TODO: is this up to 50% of the cement, or 50% of the concrete mix? 
- Much more data is available -> energy use might also be interesting to look at 

#TODO - some checks on data size..
